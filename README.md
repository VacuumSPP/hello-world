# hello-world

Hello everyone!
 
I am Eimis and I'm a 21-year-old computer science student.
I know HTML, CSS, Java, Python and bits of PHP and SQL.

I really like video games (almost 200 in Steam library) and have been wanting to get into tabletop RPGs (like D&D) for a really long time. I also like tradtional and digital art and messing around of FL Studio.

I'm very curious and excited to see what GitHub has to offer and I can't wait to be a part of many amazing projects.
